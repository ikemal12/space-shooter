# Space shooter

## Description

An endless runner game where you control a space shuttle to gain the highest score whilst shooting down enemy shuttles, avoiding obstacles and collecting powerups.   
Inspired by the likes of Subway Surfers and Temple Run.

## How to play

Clone the repo and import it as a project into Godot.   
Note: this project was developed with Godot 3 which at the time was the latest version of the engine.   
However, it no longer is therefore there may be build issues when running the game in newer versions.  
For the best experience, I recommend trying the project in Godot v3.5.1 (the version it was developed in), but if that is not available then the latest support version v3.5.3 should work as well.
